## Getting started

1. To get started farming on [Foxy-Pool CHIVES](https://chives.foxypool.io){target=_blank} please ensure you are using a NFT Pooling compatible version of the chives-blockchain software from [here](https://github.com/zcomputerwiz/chivesv2-blockchain/releases/latest){target=_blank}. This version has og-pooling support built in as well.
2. Join the pool with your existing PlotNFT:

    === "via the GUI"
        First click on "Change Pool" to enter a new pool url for your PlotNFT:

        ![join pool step 1](../../../../assets/img/getting-started/join-chives-pool-1.png){: loading=lazy }

        Then enter the pools farmer url (`https://farmer.chives.foxypool.io`) and finally click on "Change" at the bottom:

        ![join pool step 2](../../../../assets/img/getting-started/join-chives-pool-2.png){: loading=lazy }

    === "via the CLI"
        Use the following command to join the pool. If you have multiple keys you will get asked which key to use.
        ```bash
        chives plotnft join --id 2 --pool_url https://farmer.chives.foxypool.io
        ```

3. Once your PlotNFT switched over to the pool an account is created for your Launcher Id. At this point you can log in to the pools [My Farmer](https://chives.foxypool.io/my-farmer){target=_blank} tab with it, or use the login link generated by your wallet to also [authenticate](authenticate.md).

## Verify your farmer is working correctly

To verify your farmer is working correctly, please check your logs for any pooling errors.
Pooling errors can be found in your chives `debug.log` when searching for `Error in pooling`.
