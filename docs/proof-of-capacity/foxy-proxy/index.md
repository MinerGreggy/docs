## What is Foxy-Proxy

[Foxy-Proxy](https://github.com/felixbrucker/foxy-proxy) is a mining proxy which provides a few features regular miners do not yet support themselves:

- Multi-Mining support, mine as many coins as you want with custom ordering of their priorities
- Support Socket.IO based communication with Foxy-Pools or Foxy-Proxies for faster round starts and less network overhead
- Humanize deadlines, so you know exactly how low/big the deadlines are
- Add all sorts of configurable colors
- Support profitability based switching and exclusion of coins
- A Web-UI to show all sorts of information for the currently running proxies and miners connected to it
- Notifications when miners are offline/online again
