### To bind to the BURST Foxy-Pool just follow these steps:

=== "Classic wallet"

    1. Open your BURST wallet and let it sync till it is on the current height.
    2. Log into it with your plotter id passphrase:

        ![BURST Login](../../assets/img/binding/burst-bind-1.png){: loading=lazy }

    3. If you do not own any BURST, you can use the faucet available on the [pools Web UI](https://burst.foxypool.io/faucet) to get a little BURST to be able to bind to the pool.
    4. Select the Setting drop down at the top right corner and click `Reward Assignment`:

    5. In the modal appearing enter the pools address to bind to in the `Recipient` field.
    6. Use the standard fee or if you already have enough BURST you can use a higher fee for faster confirms as well.
    7. Enter your plotterId passphrase in the `Passphrase` field. If you selected "Remember passphrase during session" during login, this step is optional.

=== "Phoenix wallet"

    1. Open your Phoenix wallet and log in / import your plotter id via your plotter id passphrase:

        ![BURST Import](../../assets/img/binding/burst-phoenix-bind-1.png){: loading=lazy }

    2. Confirm the shown ID matches your plotter id:

        ![BURST Import Confirmation](../../assets/img/binding/burst-phoenix-bind-2.png){: loading=lazy }

    3. Finally setup a pin to log into the account without requiring the plotter id passphrase every time:

    6. Enter the pools address to bind to in the `Recipient` field.
    7. Use the standard fee or if you already have enough BURST you can use a higher fee for faster confirms as well.
