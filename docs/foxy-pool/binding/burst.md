3. If you do not own any BURST, you can use the faucet available on the [pools Web UI](https://burst.foxypool.io/faucet) to get a little BURST to be able to bind to the pool.
4. Select the Setting drop down at the top right corner and click `Reward Assignment`:

5. In the modal appearing enter the pools address to bind to in the `recipient` field.
6. Use the standard fee or if you already have enough BURST you can use a higher fee for faster confirms as well.
7. Enter your plotterId passphrase in the `passphrase` field. If you selected "Remember passphrase during session" during login, this step is optional.
