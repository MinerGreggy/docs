## Available pools and coins

You can always check [foxypool.cf](https://foxypool.cf) for an up-to-date list of currently running pools.
These pools are pools intended for mining and pledging (if supported).

Currently only the BHD pool does not support pledging as we do not have enough BHD to cover the pledge for it.
For BHD there is a special pledge-only pool available here: [big-hard-deck.foxypool.cf](https://big-hard-deck.foxypool.cf).
