Pledging is a way to increase your earnings on Foxy-Pools by pledging/lending coins from your wallet to the pool to achieve higher rewards during mining. You do not need to mine on a Foxy-Pool to be able to pledge.

!!! info
    Foxy-Pools generally support pledging if the coin supports it, unless stated otherwise by the pool's Web-UI.

## Pledge rewards

On Foxy-Pools your pledge share (based on your pledge compared to the sum of all pledges on that pool) earns you a share of the pledge rewards for each block won.

Pledge rewards are only available if the pool is fully pledged (BHD/HDD/LHD/XHD) or partially pledged (DISC/BTB).

To pledge to a pool follow the pools `Pledging to the pool` steps available on each pools `Info` tab in the Web-UI.
